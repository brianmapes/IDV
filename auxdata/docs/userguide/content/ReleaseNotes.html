<faqitem q="Latest netCDF-Java Version" id="nj465">

  <p>
    The version of the netCDF-Java library currently distributed with the IDV is
    the 4.6.13. This is a bug fix release.  See
    the <a href="https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/blogs/news/entry/netcdf-java-library-and-tds8">
      netCDF-Java Library</a> for a more details information.

<faqitem q="IDV Certifcates" id="cert">

  <p>
    Java Webstart, Windows app and MacOS certificates have been renewed and will
    be valid until at least May 30, 2020 (MacOS certificate is valid until
    2024). Moreover, as properly signing the IDV under these different
    environments can be an involved process, this information has thoroughly
    <a href="https://github.com/Unidata/IDV/blob/master/release/certs.md">documented
    here</a>.

<faqitem q="Isentropic Advection" id="isentropicadv">
  <p>
    For synoptic scale motions, atmospheric variables tend to be better correlated along an isentropic
    surface upstream/downstream. In a 3D space, the new grid 3D isentropic advection derived
    parameter interpolates advection from isobaric coordinate into the isentropic space and creates
    3D theta surface advection displays.

<faqitem q="GLM ADDE Chooser" id="glmAddeChooser">
  <p>
    The GLM Level2 products consist of geo-located and time-stamped events, groups, and flashes, with
    associated calibrated optical amplitudes (in units of Joules). A GLM ADDE data chooser has been developed
    to access three GLM source types: Geostationary Lightning Mapper EVENT, GROUP, and FLASH Data
    through the ADDE data server. The GLM data queries can be performed on the relative times, absolute
    times, and time driver times

<faqitem q="3D Streamline Display" id="streamline3d">
  <p>
    Streamlines are a group of curves that instantaneous tangent to the velocity vector of the flow and a snapshot of
    the flow field at some particular time. In the IDV 3D space, streamline display provides the
    direction in which a massless fluid element will travel at any point in time. 3D streamline display
    type is available for both derived parameters: Grid 3D Trajectory and 3D Flow Vectors, and the initial
    area of the 3D streamlines can be a 2D surface or a 3D volume.
  </p>
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="3D Trajectory Display Update" id="trajectoryUpdate">
  <p>
    The grid 3D trajectory display includes three new display types: Tracer Arrow, Tracer Sphere and Tracer Dot.
    The initial area of the 3D Grid Trajectory can also be set at XZ or YZ plane, and controlled by the data index
    in the X or Y direction.
  </p>
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Vertical Profile in Pressure Axis" id="pressureAzis">
  <p>
    New vertical profile display that uses pressure as its Y axis to emphasize information in the lower level atmoshpere and
    to understanding tropical convection - moisture interactions mainly concentrated in lower atmosphere. A new derived
    variable: Conserved Sounding (from theta, thetae and sat thetae), and its associated display Conserved Variable
    Sounding (Pressure) has been added to the derived parameter list of gridded dataset.

<faqitem q="Basic Grid Math" id="mapesbasicmath">
  <p>
    A collection of utilities from Mapes IDV collection performs a series of basic grid divide, multiply,
    modulo, and vertical derivative.
  </p>
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="3D Scalar Field Horizontal Smoothing" id="mapessmth">
  <p>
    A collection of utilities from Mapes IDV collection applies a series of horizontal smoothing on 3D field.
  </p>
</faqitem>

<faqitem q="Time Mean and Anomaly" id="mapestimema">
  <p>
    A collection of utilities from Mapes IDV collection calculates a series of daily, monthly, yearly mean
    and anomaly.
  </p>
